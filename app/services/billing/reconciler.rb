# Resolves transfers whose outcome we don't know by looking at what HCB
# actually did. Runs against the transfer's HQ organization (hq-usps-ops or
# hq-warehouse-ops) with the Theseus service token, so it doesn't depend on
# the user's OAuth being alive.
#
# A memo carrying *this* transfer's key is a definite match and wins
# outright. Otherwise matching is by direction + counterparty org + amount,
# restricted to transactions dated on or after the transfer was created,
# excluding any HCB transfer id we already hold and any memo carrying a
# *different* theseus key. With at most one in-flight transfer per profile
# (Billing::Charge enforces this) a single match is ours.
#
# This becomes belt-and-braces once HCB honours Idempotency-Key. See
# https://github.com/hackclub/theseus/issues/295
